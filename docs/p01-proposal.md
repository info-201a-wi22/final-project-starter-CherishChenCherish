**TODO**: Edit this file. Your project proposal goes here. Save and delete the developer notes when done.

## Developer Notes

* **Where is the project brief?**  [`../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf`](../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf).
* **Making Progress**: We understand this work might be difficult. Also, we understand that your project ideas might not be completely worked out. So, we ask that you do the best you can. You will receive specific guidance from your TA and constructive feedback. We are confident that you will succeed!
* **What should be included in the proposal?** Every proposal will be different. It depends on your particular project.  That said, in the table below you will find the expected report elements.  It is important that you engage with and respond to the the Design Brief.
* **How should the proposal be formatted?** You should format your proposal using Markdown in this file. You should aim for a professional presentation - clear, concise, interesting, and free of spelling and grammatical errors.
* **What headings should we use?** As needed, the suggested headings below can be revised and new headings and sub-headings can be added. Please use headings, bullet lists, tables, figures, and other markdown code effectively - seek a professional presentation.
* **Finishing up.** When you are finished writing and formatting your proposal, save these developer notes(they might useful in the future). Then, delete them.
* **Questions?** If you have questions, please ask your TA or post on Teams.

|Abstract |  **(1)**Our primary concern is vaccination against the new coronavirus variant. This issue is critical because the Shinkan virus is having a significant impact on people's daily lives, and in order to address it, we must first understand why and with which brands people are vaccinated **(2)** "We are concerned about both the vaccination rate and the vaccination status of people. **(3)** We plan to consider that certain vaccines could affect everyone differently
|Keywords | 1. vaccine 2. Pandemic 3. Covid-19
|1.0 Introduction | Our project is about data on vaccines, and we focus on how many people are vaccinated in the U.S., what kind of different brands of vaccines are given, and the reasons why people get vaccinated and the reasons why people refuse to get vaccinated.My group will  also being trying to see if there is a correlation with different groups of people and how they reacted to the different vaccines and covid-19 strains that are out there. In addition we also want to see if there’s a correlation with location and the different covid-19 strains. |
|2.0 Design Situation | Framing the topic of concernOur project is about data on the New Corona vaccine, specifically how many people in the United States received the vaccine, what brands of vaccines they received, and why they received the vaccine. The New Coronavirus pandemic has had a negative impact on the economy and on the lives of individuals.Human values：The vaccine is a way to assist people with the New Crown virus, knowing the vaccine data enables people to cope with the virus's effects.Stakeholders.：Individuals living in the epidemic's path, healthcare providers, and government agencies. The direct stakeholders of our topic would be the  companies that manufacture the vaccines, because they could be affected if their vaccine was deemed the least effective. One of the skills that could be assumed is that the vaccine manufacturing companies adhered to CDC guidelines. The vaccine companies want to believe that their vaccine will solve the most cases.The indirect stakeholders in our project would be the different locations could suffer in a decrease of tourists if their location has more mortality rates in conjunction with covid cases.Benefits and harms：It has the potential to improve people's understanding of their vaccination status and the efficiency with which medical structures deliver vaccines to patients.
|3.0 Research questions | 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? See the Deign Brief, section B.4. (about 150 words) |
|4.0 The Dataset | See Design Brief, setions B.5 (_Size and complexity_) and B.6 (_Data provenance_). Use short sub-sections for describing the size and complexity of the dataset and for describing the origins fo the data. (about 400 words) |
|5.0 Expected Implications | Possible implications for the technologists, designers, and policymakers could be an ethical issue arising surrounding the production or manufacturing of the vaccine. If we were misinformed regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine, there all the above professions would be implicated in the vaccine as the vaccine rollout reached so many people across the country. Another potential implication could be the human trials for testing the vaccine, and if those individuals felt like their rights were being executed properly.
|6.0 Limitations | Some limitations that we could address is we don’t know if other countries that were affected by the pandemic had the resources to mass produce vaccines such as the super power countries of the world. As a result this could affect the data because not every country has the same resources in regards to the pandemic. A limitation that might arise is the information actually being reported to and from the CDC. If different states have different methods for counting COVID-19 vaccination rates, deaths, hospitalizations, e.t.c., our data might not be as accurate as we would like it to be. The different reporting methods from each state don’t pose as big of a limitation as being unaware of the different reporting methods in different countries. |
